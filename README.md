# RPS-Multiplayer
A Firebase and jQuery-based multiplayer online Rock Paper Scissors game.

## Description
This application allows two users with separate sessions/devices to play against one another. The game follows straightforward rock paper scissors rules. Users' stats, choices, and chat messages are tracked and updated in realtime via Firebase. I took this project as an exercise in extending and hardening my skills with Firebase.

## Getting Started
To play the game, you can visit https://rock-paper-scissorss.herokuapp.com/. You won't be able to play it alone, so make sure to grab a friend (or maybe just a second browser tab)! If you prefer to run the application locally, you can clone this repository and open index.html in your web browser of choice.
